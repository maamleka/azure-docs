# Configure Personalizer containers

The **Personalizer** container runtime environment is configured using the `docker run` command arguments. This container has several required settings, along with a few optional settings. Several [examples](#example-docker-run-commands) of the command are available. The container-specific settings are the billing settings. 

## Configuration settings

This container has the following configuration settings:

|Required|Setting|Purpose|
|--|--|--|
|Yes|[ApiKey](#apikey-configuration-setting)|Used to track billing information.|
|No|[ApplicationInsights](#applicationinsights-setting)|Allows you to add [Azure Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights) telemetry support to your container.|
|Yes|[Billing](#billing-configuration-setting)|Specifies the endpoint URI of the service resource on Azure.|
|Yes|[Eula](#eula-setting)| Indicates that you've accepted the license for the container.|
|No|[Fluentd](#fluentd-settings)|Write log and, optionally, metric data to a Fluentd server.|
|No|[Http Proxy](#http-proxy-credentials-settings)|Configure an HTTP proxy for making outbound requests.|
|No|[Logging](#logging-settings)|Provides ASP.NET Core logging support for your container. |
|No|[Mounts](#mount-settings)|Read and write data from host computer to container and from container back to host computer.|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [`ApiKey`](#apikey-configuration-setting), [`Billing`](#billing-configuration-setting), and [`Eula`](#eula-setting) settings are used together, and you must provide valid values for all three of them; otherwise your container won't start. For more information about using these configuration settings to instantiate a container, see [Billing](personalizer-container-howto.md#billing).

## ApiKey configuration setting

The `ApiKey` setting specifies the Azure resource key used to track billing information for the container. You must specify a value for the ApiKey and the value must be a valid key for the _Personalizer_ resource specified for the [`Billing`](#billing-configuration-setting) configuration setting.

This setting can be found in the following place:

* Azure portal: **Personalizer's** Resource Management, under **Keys**

## ApplicationInsights setting

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration ApplicationInsights settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-application-insights.md)]

## Billing configuration setting

The `Billing` setting specifies the endpoint URI of the _Personalizer_ resource on Azure used to meter billing information for the container. You must specify a value for this configuration setting, and the value must be a valid endpoint URI for a _Personalizer_ resource on Azure.

This setting can be found in the following place:

* Azure portal: **Personalizer's** Overview, labeled `Endpoint`

|Required| Name | Data type | Description |
|--|------|-----------|-------------|
|Yes| `Billing` | String | Billing endpoint URI<br><br>Example:<br>`Billing=https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0` |

## Eula setting

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration eula settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-eula.md)]

## Fluentd settings

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration fluentd settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-fluentd.md)]

## Http proxy credentials settings

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration fluentd settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-http-proxy.md)]

## Logging settings
 
[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration logging settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-logging.md)]


## Mount settings

Use bind mounts to read and write data to and from the container. You can specify an input mount or output mount by specifying the `--mount` option in the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command.

The containers don't use input or output mounts to store training or service data. 

The exact syntax of the host mount location varies depending on the host operating system. Additionally, the [host computer](personalizer-container-howto.md#the-host-computer)'s mount location may not be accessible due to a conflict between permissions used by the docker service account and the host mount location permissions. 

|Optional| Name | Data type | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
|Not allowed| `Input` | String | Personalizer containers do not use this.|
|Optional| `Output` | String | The target of the output mount. The default value is `/output`. This is the location of the logs. This includes container logs. <br><br>Example:<br>`--mount type=bind,src=c:\output,target=/output`|

## Example docker run commands 

The following examples use the configuration settings to illustrate how to write and use `docker run` commands.  Once running, the container continues to run until you [stop](personalizer-container-howto.md#stop-the-container) it.

* **Line-continuation character**: The Docker commands in the following sections use the back slash, `\`, as a line continuation character for a bash shell. Replace or remove this based on your host operating system's requirements. For example, the line continuation character for windows is a caret, `^`. Replace the back slash with the caret. 
* **Argument order**: Do not change the order of the arguments unless you are very familiar with Docker containers.

Replace the value in brackets, `{}`, with your own values:

| Placeholder | Value | Format or example |
|-------------|-------|---|
|{BILLING_KEY} | The endpoint key of the Personalizer resource. |xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|
|{BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI} | The billing endpoint value including region.|`https://westus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/`|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Eula`, `Billing`, and `ApiKey` options must be specified to run the container; otherwise, the container won't start.  For more information, see [Billing](personalizer-container-howto.md#billing).
> The ApiKey value is the **Key** from the Azure Personalizer Resource keys page. 

## Personalizer container Docker examples

The following Docker examples are for the Personalizer container. 

### Basic example 

  ```Docker
  docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 4g --cpus 1 \
  mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/[container-name] \
  Eula=accept \
  Billing={BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI} \
  ApiKey={BILLING_KEY} 
  ```

### Logging example with command-line arguments

  ```Docker
  docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 4g --cpus 1 \
  mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/[container-name] \
  Eula=accept \
  Billing={BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI} ApiKey={BILLING_KEY} \
  Logging:Console:LogLevel:Default=Information
  ```
