#	Conditional skill

The **Conditional skill** enables a variety of scenarios that require a boolean operation to decide the data that should be assigned to an output. These scenarios include: filtering, assigning a default value and merging data based on a condition.

The following pseudocode explains what the Conditional Skill accomplishes:

```
if (condition) 
    { output = whenTrue } 
else 
    { output = whenFalse } 
```

> [!NOTE]
> This skill is not bound to a Cognitive Services API and you are not charged for using it. You should still [attach a Cognitive Services resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md), however, to override the **Free** resource option that limits you to a small number of daily enrichments per day.

## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Util.ConditionalSkill


## Evaluated fields

This skill is special because its inputs are evaluated fields.

The following are valid values of an expression:

-	Annotation Paths (paths in expressions must be delimited by "$(" and ")") <br/>
    Examples:
    ```
        "= $(/document)"
        "= $(/document/content)"
    ```

-  Literals (strings, numbers, true, false, null) <br/>
    Examples:
    ```
       "= 'this is a string'"   // string, note the single quotes
       "= 34"                   // number
       "= true"                 // boolean
       "= null"                 // null value
    ```

-  Expressions that use a comparison operator (==, !=, >=, >, <=, <) <br/>
    Examples:
    ```
        "= $(/document/language) == 'en'"
        "= $(/document/sentiment) >= 0.5"
    ```

-	Expressions that use boolean operators  (&&, ||, !, ^) <br/>
    Examples:
    ```
        "= $(/document/language) == 'en' && $(/document/sentiment) > 0.5"
        "= !true"
    ```

-	Expressions that use a numeric operator (+, -, \*, /, %) <br/>
    Examples: 
    ```
        "= $(/document/sentiment) + 0.5"         // addition
        "= $(/document/totalValue) * 1.10"       // multiplication
        "= $(/document/lengthInMeters) / 0.3049" // division
    ```

Because of the evaluation supported, the Conditional Skill can be used for minor transformation scenarios. See sample [skill definition 4](#transformation-examples) for an example.

## Skill inputs
Inputs are case-sensitive.

| Inputs	  | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| condition   | This input is an [evaluated field](#evaluated-fields) that represents the condition to evaluate. This condition should evaluate to a boolean value (true or false).   <br/>  Examples: <br/> "= true" <br/> "= $(/document/language) =='fr'" <br/> "= $(/document/pages/\*/language) == $(/document/expectedLanguage)" <br/> |
| whenTrue    | This input is an [evaluated field](#evaluated-fields). The value to return if the condition is evaluated to true. Constants strings should be returned in ' ' quotes. <br/>Sample values: <br/> "= 'contract'"<br/>"= $(/document/contractType)" <br/> "= $(/document/entities/\*)" <br/> |
| whenFalse   | This input is an [evaluated field](#evaluated-fields). The value to return if the condition is evaluated to false.  <br/>Sample values: <br/> "= 'contract'"<br/>"= $(/document/contractType)" <br/> "= $(/document/entities/\*)" <br/>

## Skill outputs
There is a single output called 'output'. It will return the value of whenFalse if the condition is false, or whenTrue if the condition is true.

## Examples

###	Sample skill definition 1: Filtering documents to return only "French" documents

The following output will return an array of sentences ("/document/frenchSentences") if the language of the document is french. If the language is not french, that value will be set to null.

```json
{
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Util.ConditionalSkill",
    "context": "/document",
    "inputs": [
        { "name": "condition", "source": "= $(/document/language) == 'fr'" },
        { "name": "whenTrue", "source": "/document/sentences" },
        { "name": "whenFalse", "source": "= null" }
    ],
    "outputs": [ { "name": "output", "targetName": "frenchSentences" } ]
}
```
If "/document/frenchSentences" is used as the *context* of another skill, that skill will only run if "/document/frenchSentences" is not set to null


###	Sample skill definition 2: Setting a default value when it does not exist.

The following output will create an annotation ("/document/languageWithDefault") that is set to either the language of the document, or "es" if the language is not set.

```json
{
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Util.ConditionalSkill",
    "context": "/document",
    "inputs": [
        { "name": "condition", "source": "= $(/document/language) == null" },
        { "name": "whenTrue", "source": "= 'es'" },
        { "name": "whenFalse", "source": "= $(/document/language)" }
    ],
    "outputs": [ { "name": "output", "targetName": "languageWithDefault" } ]
}
```

###	Sample skill definition 3: Merging values from two different fields into a single field

In this example, some sentences have a *frenchSentiment* property. Whenever the *frenchSentiment* property is null, we would like to use the *englishSentiment* value. We assign the output to a member called simply *sentiment* ("/document/sentiment/*/sentiment").

```json
{
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Util.ConditionalSkill",
    "context": "/document/sentences/*",
    "inputs": [
        { "name": "condition", "source": "= $(/document/sentences/*/frenchSentiment) == null" },
        { "name": "whenTrue", "source": "/document/sentences/*/englishSentiment" },
        { "name": "whenFalse", "source": "/document/sentences/*/frenchSentiment" }
    ],
    "outputs": [ { "name": "output", "targetName": "sentiment" } ]
}
```

## Transformation examples
###	Sample skill definition 4: Performing data transformations on a single field

In this example, we receive a sentiment between 0 and 1, and we would like to transform it so that it is between -1 and 1. This is a small math transformation that we could do using the Conditional Skill.

In this specific example, we never use the conditional aspect of the skill as the condition is always true. 

```json
{
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Util.ConditionalSkill",
    "context": "/document/sentences/*",
    "inputs": [
        { "name": "condition", "source": "= true" },
        { "name": "whenTrue", "source": "= $(/document/sentences/*/sentiment) * 2 - 1" },
        { "name": "whenFalse", "source": "= 0" }
    ],
    "outputs": [ { "name": "output", "targetName": "normalizedSentiment" } ]
}
```


## Special considerations
Note that some of the parameters are evaluated, so you need to be especially careful following the documented pattern. Expressions must start with an equals sign "=" and paths must be delimited by "$(" and ")". Make sure to put your strings in 'single quotes' as that will help the evaluator distinguish between strings and actual paths and operators. Also, make sure to put a whitespace around operators (for instance a * in a path has a different meaning than the multiplication operator).
